Auto-Cyberoam-Login-Client
==========================

A simple ruby shoes app, acts as a cyberoam login client for DA-IICT student. 


To Dos:
------

1. Use start and stop method for starting and stoping 'every block', rather the simulating it with sequencial timer call.

2. Instead of using gem nori and nokogiri , use Hpricot (comes as already required in Shoes, so better performance)

3. Checkout on where and when notifications should be given ideally.

4. Encrypt and Decrypt password information before storage.

5. Check everything on Windows, Mac and linux.

6. Make code, more readable and managable in files.

7. Package and Deploy executables :)

8. Try to shift the app to Shoes4, may be the windows popup problem might get solved then. BTW, open an issue for that to in Shoes 3.2 as suggested by Cecil.

9. Find a smarter way for keeping windows and linux code different.

10. Update help links for widows users.

11. Update executables so that, they install app:-> (setup icon , setup HotKey and setup Dash)

12. For linux, check for cron support and try to enable it for the required users.
